# FitGuard 
One of the main causes of death in the globe is cancer. Cancer patients' chances of recovery and quality of life can be greatly increased by early identification and effective treatments. But a lot of people may not know their risk factors, early cancer warning signals, or when to get the right kind of medical screening. Furthermore, it is still difficult to get personalized, pertinent information and healthcare services, particularly in places with weak infrastructure for these services.

## Key issue:
- Ignorance about Cancer Risks: Many people are unaware of the risk factorsᅳsuch as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposuresᅳthat can raise their risk of developing cancer. As a result, cancer is frequently discovered at an advanced stage, when there are fewer therapeutic choices available.
  
- Limited Access to Useful Personal Data: Although a lot of medical data is readily available online, it is sometimes impersonal. Since every person has unique risk factors, generic information might not be adequate to offer personalized and pertinent suggestions.
  
- Accessibility Gaps: It is still quite difficult to get oncology doctors or medical facilities in many places for cancer screening. This makes early detection more difficult, particularly in rural areas and underdeveloped nations <br>
<br> As a result of the aforementioned concerns, we created 'FitGuard' with the goal of assisting in the resolution of these challenges by providing personalized cancer risk and health screening suggestions. The app provides personalized advise by utilizing Machine Learning (ML) technology and medical data analysis.
